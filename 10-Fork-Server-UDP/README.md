Unfinished concurrent UDP Server to handle multiple Client connections using fork()

## 10-Fork-Server-UDP (Unfinished)

A concurrent version of the **UDP Server** using `fork()`, to fork a separate process on receiving data with recvfrom to deal with each **Client** connection

###### This socket is incomplete

##### Files:

Code and application included in folder:

| No. | File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **serveruf.c** | UDP Fork Server Code |
| 2 | **clientua.c** | TEST: Asynchronous UDP Client Code |
| 3 | **srv** | UDP Fork Server Application |
| 4 | **cli** | TEST: Asynchronous UDP Client Application |

##### Dependencies (Placed in root directory):

Files the UDP Fork Server is dependent on:

1. DrawHangman.h
2. Hangman.h
3. CreateUDPSocket.h
4. Socket.h
5. UDPPlayHangman.h"

## Running:

The included **Asynchronous UDP Client** communicates with the **Server** using `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` (Test Server application srv included in directory)

To run the included compiled **UDP Fork Server** with default port number `1068`:
```c
./srv
```

To run **Server** specifying the port number to listen for **Client** connections on e.g. port `8000`:
```c
./srv 8000

###### With UDP Test Server application running, the Client must use the same port when sending data with sendto()

To run the included compiled **Test Asynchronous UDP Client** with default port number `1068`:
```c
./cli
```

## Compiling:

To compile the **UDP Fork Server** code:
```c
gcc -o srv serveruf.c
```

To compile the included Test code for **UDP Asynchronous Client**:
```c
gcc -o cli clientua.c
```
