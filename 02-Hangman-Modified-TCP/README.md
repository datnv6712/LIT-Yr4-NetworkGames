## 02-Hangman-Modified-TCP

**Modified Hangman Game**, with graphics, coloured text, and functionality to set up sockets, and play the game separated to header files

##### Files:

Code and application included in folder:

| No. | File | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **serverm.c** | Modified Server Code |
| 2 | **clientm.c** | Modified Client Code |
| 3 | **srv** | Server Application |
| 4 | **cli** | Client Application |

##### Dependencies (Placed in root directory):
Files that the client is dependent on to compile:

1. DrawHangman.h
2. Hangman.h
3. CreateTCPSocket.h

Additional **Server** dependencies:

1. Socket.h
2. TCPPlayHangman.h

## Running:

To run the existing compiled **Server** with default port number `1066`:
```c
./srv
```
To run **Server** specifying the port number to listen for **Client** connections on e.g. port `8000`:
```c
./srv 8000
```

###### With Server application running, the Client must connect to the same port

To run the existing compiled **Client** with default IP Address and default port number: 
```c
./cli
```

To run the **Client** specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and default port: 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10
```

To run the **Client** specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and port `8000` (Client port must match Server): 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10 8000
```

The **Client** can also connect using `localhost`
```c
./cli localhost
```

And the **Client** can also connect specifying the name of a PC e.g. `Joe-PC`
```c
./cli Joe-PC
```

## Compiling:

To compile the **Client** code (with the dependent files in parent directory):
```c
gcc -o cli clientm.c
```

To compile the **Server** code:
```c
gcc -o srv serverm.c
```

Where `cli` and `srv` are the names of the compiled programs
