##### 6-Hangman-UDP

The Modified Hangman Client and Server using `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` to communicate between each other in a connectionless state over UDP

##### Files:

1. serveru.c (UDP Server code)
2. clientu.c (UDP Client code)
3. srv (UDP Server Application)
4. cli (UDP Client Application)

##### Dependencies (Placed in root directory):
Files that the Select Server is dependent on to compile:

1. DrawHangman.h
2. Hangman.h
3. CreateUDPSocket.h
4. Socket.h
5. UDPPlayHangman.h

Files the Client (Modified to work with the Select Server) is dependent on:

0. None 

## Running:

This UDP Server application will communicate with the included UDP Client application using `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`

To run the existing compiled Select Server with default port number `1068` (Different to TCP `1066`):
```c
./srv
```

To run Server specifying the port number to listen for client connections on e.g. port `8000`:
```c
./srv 8000
```

###### With UDP Server application running, the Client must use the same port when sending data


The already compiled Client application included in the directory can be run with commands: 

```c
./cli
```

To run the Client specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and default port: 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10
```

To run the Client specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and port `8000`: 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10 8000
```

The Client can also connect using `localhost`
```c
./cli localhost
```

And the Client can also connect specifying the name of a PC e.g. `Joe-PC`
```c
./cli Joe-PC
```

## Compiling:

To compile the Select Server code (with the dependent files in parent directory):
```c
gcc -o srv serveru.c
```

To compile the Select Client code:
```c
gcc -o cli clientu.c
```
