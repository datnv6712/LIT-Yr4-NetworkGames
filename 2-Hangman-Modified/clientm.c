	22/11/2017 	Removed additional read after while loop, can't remember why it was there
			gameOverText() in DrawHangman.h sets a game over message based on the number
	 		of lives the player has left
			parseWordAndLives() moved to Hangman.h from DrawHangman.h, function now takes
			a draw paramater and calls amputate if set, or can be left as text only
	16/10/2017	amputate() in DrawHangman.h displays graphical representation of lives lost
	13/10/2017	DrawHangman.h added to create ASCII graphics
	12/10/2017	Added header files for shared game variables and methods
	19/09/2017 	Added includes to get rid of compile warnings (wasn't necessary)
			Game Over message displayed after connection to Server terminates
	23/09/2017	Added include to clear warning on read(), write()
			Added hangman graphic
