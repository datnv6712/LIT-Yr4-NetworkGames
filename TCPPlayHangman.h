 /* 
 	File: 		TCPPlayHangman.h
	Version: 	play_hangman() function split to be used with modified, fork, and select hangman servers
	Modified by:	Joe O'Regan

	Year 4 Networked Games Assignment

	Team 1:
	Joe O'Regan 	K00203642
	Samantha Marah	K00200782
	Jason Foley 	K00186690

	Reconfigured version of SetupTCPServerSocket() function from TCPServerUtility.c
	from TCP/IP Sockets in C book, to work with TCP Hangman fork() server

	22/11/2017	checkGuess() now highlights in colour if it was a good/bad guess in
			text displayed on Server
			sendPartWord() is used to send the part word/lives string to the client
	18/11/2017 	Moved play_hangman() functionality to its own file to be used by
			both the modified and fork() versions of the game
