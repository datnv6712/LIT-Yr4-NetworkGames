	Version: 	Modified version of Hangman Server

	Year 4 Networked Games Assignment

	Network server for hangman game with fork()

	Concurrent Hangman Server: handles multiple clients at a time by forking a child copy of the server for each new client connection
	The Unix fork function is the simplest technique for a concurrent server, creating one cheild process for each client.

	Team 1:
	Joe O'Regan 	K00203642
	Samantha Marah	K00200782
	Jason Foley 	K00186690
	
	18/11/2017	Separated play_hangman functionality to TCPPlayHangman.h
	14/10/2017	Added separate files to handle creating the socket, and displaying the address and port number
	08/10/2017	Added forking capability for server. 
			Game is exactly the same for each client, so moved random number seeding to while loop
			Displays the word the client was guessing on the server side
	23/09/2017 	Added includes to get rid of compile warnings (wasn't necessary)
			Client IP and Port number is displayed when a connection is made
			Win/Lose message displayed, and sent to Client to display
			Added hangman graphic
