##  04. Fork Server TCP

A concurrent version of the **TCP Server** using `fork()`, to fork a separate process to deal with each **Client** connection

##### Files:

1. serverf.c (code)
2. srv (Forking Server Application)
3. cli (2-Hangman-Modified-TCP Client Application)

##### Dependencies (Placed in root directory):
Files that the client is dependent on to compile:

1. DrawHangman.h
2. Hangman.h
3. CreateTCPSocket.h
4. Socket.h
5. TCPPlayHangman.h

## Running:

This **Server** application will communicate with the included **Client** application (cli) from 2-Hangman-Modified-TCP

To run the existing compiled **Forking Server** with default port number `1066`:
```c
./srv
```
To run **Server** specifying the port number to listen for **Client** connections on e.g. port `8000`:
```c
./srv 8000
```

####### With Forking Server application running, the Client must connect to the same port
The already compiled **Client** application included in the directory can be run with command: 
```c
./srv
```
Or see README.md in 02-Hangman-Modified-TCP for further **Client** running instructions

## Compiling:

To compile the **Forking Server** code (with the dependent files in parent directory):
```c
gcc -o srv serverf.c
```
