Concurrent Server using select() to handle multiple Client connections

## 5-Hangman-Select-TCP

A concurrent version of the **TCP Server** using `select()`, to handle input from different **Client** connections by one **Server** process

##### Files:

Code and application included in folder:
| --- | File        | Description           |
| --- | ------------- |-------------|
| 1. | **servers.c** | Concurrent Select Server Code |
| 2. | **client.c** | Test: Client Code |
| 3. | **srv** | Concurrent Select Server Application |
| 4. | **cli** | Test: Client Application |

##### Dependencies (Placed in root directory):
Files that the **Select Server** is dependent on to compile:

1. DrawHangman.h
2. Hangman.h
3. CreateTCPSocket.h
4. Socket.h
5. TCPPlayHangman.h
6. GameState.h

Files the **Client** (Modified to work with the Select Server) is dependent on:

0. None 

## Running:

This concurrent **Select Server** application will communicate with the included **Client** application

To run the existing compiled **Select Server** with default port number `1066`:
```c
./srv
```

To run **Server** specifying the port number to listen for **Client** connections on e.g. port `8000`:
```c
./srv 8000
```

###### With Select Server application running, the Client must connect to the same port


The already compiled **Client** application included in the directory can be run with commands:
```c
./cli
```

To run the **Client** specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and default port: 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10
```

To run the **Client** specifying an IP Address `193.168.1.10` and port `5000`: 
```c
./cli 193.168.1.10 5000
```

The **Client** can also connect using `localhost`
```c
./cli localhost
```

And the **Client** can also connect specifying the name of a PC e.g. `Joe-PC`
```c
./cli Joe-PC
```

## Compiling:

To compile the **Select Server** code (with the dependent files in parent directory):
```c
gcc -o srv servers.c
```

To compile the **Select Client** code:
```c
gcc -o cli clients.c
```
